Chrome network inspector shows API headers/body vs Q2 API debugger extension shows Tecton request key and request/response payloads.

Meta contains internal API requests the backend does. In each request, we can see the body that is being passed, HTTP method, API url and also the response.

Columns can be resizable, we can change the size of the columns like the same in network inspector.

Copy the request data, response data with a single right mouse click.
